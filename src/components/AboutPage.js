            As a design firm we specialise in multidisciplinary design domains
            like Residence design, Retail design, exhibition design, Commercial
            Architecture, Interior design, and Museum Architecture with a focus

            We explore ways to engage the user, the way they move through the
            space. We like taking design to an extremely conceptual stage. We
            find inspiration in ordinary things, everyday events and chance
            encounters.

            The firm takes a deeply contextual approach to its work and combines
            this with a strong focus on the tactile and sensory qualities of the
            space. Our design process looks at sustainability through the
            multiple lenses of cultural, social and environmental impact. There
            is an active engagement in integrating localised skills and
            resources with state-of-the art materials and technologies.
